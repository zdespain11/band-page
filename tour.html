    <p class="text"> No Tour Up Just Yet </p>
<p>By the graces of the almighty wonderful Lord, one of the best hard rock bands is back, and they’ve brought a whole album full of new music.
     Yes, AC/DC has returned with a vengeance and all the original members who are still alive are involved. Brian Johnson had his hearing issue
      addressed and sounds freaking awesome on the new album, Angus Young is still tearing up on lead guitar, Cliff Williams is back on Bass, 
      Phil Rudd is back behind the drums, and taking the spot of Malcom is his nephew Stevie Young.
 
    The new album is titled POWER UP, or PWRUP as AC/DC first released it as. #PWRUP was the viral hashtag they used to promote it. If you haven’t 
    listened to any of the songs yet, you’re in for a treat. This is a typical ass kicking AC/DC album, yet it means so much more because no one ever 
    expected to see the band back together with all the remaining original members. Down below we have each song on the new album, and their music video. 
    Enjoy AC/DC’s new album PWR UP.</p>
